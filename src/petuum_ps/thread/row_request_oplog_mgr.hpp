// Keep track of row requests that are sent to server or that could
// be potentially sent to server (row does not exist in process cache
// but a request for that row has been sent out).

// When a requested row is not found in process cache, the bg worker
// checks with RowRequestMgr to see if it has sent out a request for
// that row. If not, send the current request; otherwise, wait for
// server response.

// When the bg worker, receives a reply for a row, it inserts that
// row into process cache and checks with RowRequestMgr to see how many
// row requests that reply may satisfy.

// After a row request is sent to server and before the bg worker receives the
// reply, the bg worker might have sent out multiple sets of updates to server.
// Since the server may buffer the row and reply later, those updates might or
// might not be applied to the row on server.

// Bg worker assgins a mononically-increasing version number for each set of
// updates. The locall version number denotes the latest version of updates
// that have been sent to server. When a row request is sent out, it contains
// the current local version number. Since server receives and processes
// messages in order, when a row request is processed by the server, all updates
// prior to that version (including that version) have been apply to the row on
// the server.

// When the server receives a set of updates from that client after it buffers
// the row request, it should increment the row request's version number
// accordingly. Thus when the client receives a reply for a row request, it
// knows which version of updates have been applied and it should apply the
// missing updates to that row before inserting it to process cache.

// RowRequestMgr is also responsible for keeping track of the sent oplogs. An
// oplog cannot be deleted until all row requests sent prior to its version
// (exclusive) have been replied.
